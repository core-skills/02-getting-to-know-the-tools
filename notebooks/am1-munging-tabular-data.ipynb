    "# Munging tabular data\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to go through how to munge tabular data in more detail (and _slowly_). The aim is for you to get comfortable with the tools we're using:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [pandas](pandas.pydata.org) for data handling (our dataframe library)\n",
    "- [seaborn](seaborn.pydata.org) for _nice_ data visualization\n",
    "- [scipy](scipy.org) for scientific libraries (particularly `scipy.stats` which we'll use for fitting some more unusual probability distributions), and \n",
    "- [statsmodels](statsmodels.org) which gives us some more expressive curve fitting approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "The other aim is to get familiar with code-sharing workflows - so we will be doing pair programming for the duration of the day! \n",
    "\n",
    "*You will probably want to take a moment to look at the documentation of the libraries above - especially `pandas`.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The other useful resource is Stack Overflow - if you have a question that sounds like 'how do I do {x}' then someone will probably have answered it on Stack Overflow. Questions are also tagged by library so if you have a particular pandas question you can do something like going to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pandas (just replace the 'pandas' in the URL with whatever library you're trying to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally answers on Stack Overflow are probably a lot closer to getting you up and running than the documentation. Once you get used to the library then the documentation is generally a quicker reference. We will cover strategies for getting help in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Git links\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be working through using GitHub and GitKraken to share code between pairs. We will go through all the workflow in detail in class but here are some useful links for reference:\n",

    "- Staging and committing (save current state -> local history): https://support.gitkraken.com/working-with-commits/commits\n",
    "- Pushing and pulling (sync local history <-> GitHub history): https://support.gitkraken.com/working-with-repositories/pushing-and-pulling\n",
    "- Forking and pull requests (request to sync your GitHub history <-> someone else's history - requires a _review_):\n",
