    "This exercise will go through systematically examining your dataset and producing a bit of a report which you can use to communicate the content, features and subtleties of your dataset. If you have a tablular dataset ready to go, we'd encourage you to use it! We've provided an example or two of going through this process (see the other pm notebooks). These example data reports are principally based on data which is relatively clean already - to highlight the key parts of the exercise without getting bogged down in the details of data munging which are often dataset specific."
