# Day 4 Introduction

The morning will be spent practising some collaborative development.
We'll first spend some time going over Git, GitHub and GitKraken before doing a small series of exercises in pairs.
By the end of the morning, you should have had a bit of practise with the develop & synchronize workflow for shared programming, and be able to effectively code in pairs (pair programming model) and share the results of the pair programming.

There should also be plenty of time to look around at other things as needed.

## Collaborative Development and Data Sharing Workflows
### Starting From an Existing Repository: Cloning and Forking


### Processes for Collaborative Development

There are multiple options for processes to follow during collaborative development.

Some are more productive than others when you have multiple people contributing.

If everyone's concurrently committing to the same branch from separate local repositories, if you're working on the same files, you'll find that merge conflicts
are likely to be your biggest hurdle.


## Code Kata

Code Kata are short exercises or drills designed to develop your skills.
The phrase 'kata' is taken from the martial arts concept, and has been in use from at least 1999<sup><a id="a1">[#](#f1)</a></sup>.

These exercises often have many potential solutions, and can be repeated
multiple times to get a feel for what small improvements you may be able
to make.

Using code kata to supplement your development is one way to get around the
"it's hard to learn on the job" aspect of learning and developing your
projects. Getting feedback on your solutions is useful, which is why we'll
be spending time coding in pairs this morning. But the key thing is that
the exercises are not intended to be an 'under pressure' scenario - they're
for, and only for, development purposes. Take them slow at least the first
time around, break down the problem, and think about why you make prefer one approach over another.

## Before we Get Started: Recap

### Where am I?

| :question: How do I find where my python code is running? |
| ---------------------------------------------- |

| :question: How do I specify a path to my data directory? |
| -------------------------------------------------------- |
|                                                          |
|                                                          |
###  Functions, Objects and Methods

Short recap of Python objects – data + code that operates on that data vs functions (code that takes some input)


## Wrapping Up

Pair up for the morning! We'll swap a few times during the day.
