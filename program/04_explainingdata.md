# Explaining Data

## `seaborn` vs. `matplotlib`

## Visualising Data

Synchronise code and swap over.

##	How do I explain my data to others?

Working in pairs, we'll develop an overview of our datasets and explain some of the concepts we've learnt this morning. 

Suggested basic report structure:
1. What's the purpose of the dataset?
1. Why might I be interested?
1. How big a dataset are we talking?
1. What are the variables? Data types? How do you deal with missing data?
1. Develop an interesting visualization of the data, and note how you might investigate it further (new data/more analysis/more modelling..?)
1. Find another dataset that we could use to fuse with this one.
