# Explaining Data

## Visualising Data

| 30 mins |
| ------- |

In pairs, have one person bring up the seaborn documentation and find a few
of the plotting examples which might be relevant for their data.

Generate a few plots using `pandas`, `seaborn` or `matplotlib`.

| :question: Where might different plots be useful? |
| ------------------------------------------------- |
| Get another one working for your data.            |

| :triangular_flag_on_post: Is everyone up to speed? How are people going? |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

Synchronise code and swap over.

### `seaborn` vs. `matplotlib`

We've played a little with `seaborn` today. You may notice that some things
are similar, and others quite different to e.g. `matplotlib`. `seaborn`
is a higher-level library which itself is based on `matplotlib`, but
adds a bit of functionality (especially for statistical visualisations)
and abstracts away some of the details.

##	How do I explain my data to others?

| 60 mins |
| ------- |

Working in pairs, we'll develop an overview of our datasets and explain some of the concepts we've learnt this morning.

Put together a simple overview report. A suggested basic report structure:
1. What's the purpose of the dataset?
1. Why might I be interested?
1. How big a dataset are we talking?
1. What are the variables? Data types? How do you deal with missing data?
1. Develop an interesting visualization of the data, and note how you might investigate it further (new data/more analysis/more modelling..?)
1. Find another dataset that we could use to fuse with this one.

| :question: What are some good ways to communicate this information? |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| :question: How might you store some of this with your data (i.e. as a 'metadata record')? |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
